# 50projects

This 50 unique mini-projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (VanillaJS) to sharpen skills in
basic web technologies related to DOM manipulation.
These several projects are like a small sub-part of the website and its core
knowledge can be implemented for a bigger website/project. Each mini-project uses different
CSS and JavaScript knowledge hoping to leverage my skill level on them.
Due to it being unique on its own, it can be useful to use the basic (core knowledge)
to implement other project.
