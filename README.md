# <> 50 Mini Projects (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript) </>

This 50 unique mini-projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (VanillaJS) to sharpen skills in
basic web technologies related to DOM manipulation.
These several projects are a small sub-part of the website and its core
concepts can be implemented for another personal project or in a new context related to it. Each mini-project uses different CSS and JavaScript elements hoping to leverage my skill level on them.
I believe it can be very useful by building this project to explore different CSS and JS concepts that I might not have used before.

The showcase can be viewed <a href="https://mekdie.github.io/50projects/" target="_blank">here</a>.

**_Expected to finish all 50 projects in the early of 2023_**
